# ENGINEERING/THINKING PROCESS


I decided to generated a component ‘timeline’ to make more it reusable, and do the routes to facilitate do the applications in modules, in this component I will put a button with a function that increase one counter, and put every new counter in a a array, to make enter each component of my timeline through a ngFor, this content will be displayed in alternative sides, so I intend to create a condition for even and odd numbers presented in the array with the counted elements to decide if the class is right or left,  the most recent additions will be showed on the top of the line reversing the array. 


To created the structure, I used this base https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_timeline.asp, and change the CSS to match the given example.
